# Jupyter Server Launcher

This repository contains a small Flask application that launches a Jupyter Lab server inside a Kubernetes pod.

The web interface provides a single button which starts the pod and shows a progress bar until Jupyter is ready. Once the notebook server is up, the page redirects to the running instance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster with GPU nodes
- The [Kubernetes Python client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python) and `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- `pip` to install Python dependencies

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser and click **Start Jupyter Notebook**. The server creates a Kubernetes pod in the background, waits for the Jupyter Lab token, and then redirects your browser to the running notebook.

The application keeps the generated Jupyter URL in memory while the pod starts.

## Customisation

`container_manager.py` contains the logic for starting the Kubernetes pod. You can modify the image or startup command there if required. The script selects a node that still has available GPUs and schedules the pod on it.

### Kubernetes Setup

1. Ensure your kubeconfig is accessible (e.g. via `~/.kube/config`).
2. The nodes must expose the GPU resource as `nvidia.com/gpu`.
3. Install the Python dependencies and then start the Flask server as described above.
